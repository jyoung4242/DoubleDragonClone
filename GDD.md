## ‚öîÔ∏è Core Gameplay Systems

### Combat

- Light/Heavy attacks, grabs, throws, aerials, and tag-team switches.

- **Unique Skill Branches**: Small (3‚Äì5 nodes), impactful, partially unique per character; unlocked via collectibles or quests.
- **Augments**: Modify or enhance abilities (e.g., Iron Fist, Steel Body, Dragon Step, Eagle Grip); stackable and synergistic.
- **Combo Hints / Input Prompts**: Minimal by default; expanded through collectibles to teach advanced sequences; dynamically adapt to
  input method.

### Team Building

- Recruit allies via exploration, quests, or rival encounters.
