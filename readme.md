# Path of the Fist

![Project Logo Placeholder](./Logo.png)

**Path of the Fist** is an open-source, modular framework for creating fast-paced, combo-driven arena combat games with hub-based level
design, recruitable party members, collectible-driven progression, and narrative-driven dialogues. Inspired by classic beat ‚Äôem ups
like _Double Dragon_ and _River City Ransom_, this game modernizes the genre while remaining grounded in realistic martial arts
mechanics.

Built on **[ExcaliburJS](https://excaliburjs.com/)**, a robust HTML5 game engine, this project leverages Excalibur‚Äôs actor system,
physics, and rendering pipeline while adding modular combat, AI, and progression systems.
